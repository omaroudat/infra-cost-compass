## Important Notes

1. **First Admin Setup**: After deployment, create the first user account through the normal signup process, then manually update their role to 'admin' in the Supabase dashboard.

2. **Email Confirmation**: For testing, disable email confirmation in Supabase Auth settings. For production, enable it for better security.

3. **Rate Limiting**: The application includes basic rate limiting. Consider implementing additional rate limiting at the infrastructure level for production.

4. **Error Handling**: The application includes comprehensive error handling and validation. Monitor error logs to identify any issues in production.

5. **Real-time Features**: Real-time updates are enabled for all tables. Monitor performance and consider disabling for non-critical updates if needed.
