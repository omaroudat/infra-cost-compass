# BOQ Items — Business Features & Integrations

## 1. Plain-English Summary

The BOQ (Bill of Quantities) Items module is the foundational cost management system that defines all project deliverables, their quantities, units of measurement, and associated costs. BOQ serves as the master reference document that drives all project financial planning, progress tracking, and payment processing. Project managers, quantity surveyors, and engineers use this module to establish the project baseline, manage scope changes, and ensure accurate cost control throughout project execution. Every construction activity, material requirement, and service delivery is represented as a BOQ item with precise specifications and pricing.

## 2. Key Business Outcomes

• **Accurate Project Costing**: Establishes precise baseline costs for all project deliverables, enabling accurate budget planning and financial forecasting with detailed unit rates and quantities.

• **Scope Management**: Provides clear definition of project boundaries and deliverables, preventing scope creep through structured item categorization and approval workflows.

• **Progress Measurement**: Enables quantifiable progress tracking by linking physical work completion to specific BOQ items with measurable units and milestones.

• **Payment Accuracy**: Ensures accurate contractor payments by providing approved unit rates and quantities that feed directly into invoice calculations and payment certificates.

• **Change Control**: Facilitates systematic management of project variations through structured BOQ amendments with full audit trails and approval hierarchies.

• **Resource Planning**: Supports detailed resource allocation and procurement planning by breaking down work packages into specific materials, labor, and equipment requirements.

• **Risk Management**: Identifies cost risks early through detailed quantity analysis and enables proactive mitigation through accurate baseline establishment.

• **Compliance Reporting**: Supports regulatory compliance and audit requirements through detailed cost breakdowns and systematic documentation of all project expenditures.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 BOQ Item Creation and Management

**When Used**: During project initiation, scope definition, and when variations occur

**Step-by-Step Flow**:
• User selects project and discipline context for new BOQ item creation
• System presents structured input form with mandatory fields (code, description, unit, quantity, rate)
• User enters item details with hierarchical categorization and cost center assignment
• System validates business rules (duplicate codes, rate reasonableness, quantity logic)
• Item is saved in draft status pending review and approval workflow initiation
• Notification sent to designated reviewers based on item value thresholds and approval matrix

**Business Rules/Validations**:
• BOQ codes must follow organizational numbering conventions (e.g., 01.02.003 format)
• Unit rates cannot exceed predefined maximum thresholds without senior approval
• Quantities must be positive numbers with appropriate decimal precision for the unit type
• Items cannot be deleted if referenced by existing Break-Downs or WIRs
• Total item value (quantity × unit rate) triggers approval workflow based on value thresholds

**Inputs & Outputs**:
• Inputs: Item code, description (English/Arabic), unit of measurement, quantity, unit rate, discipline, cost center
• Outputs: Approved BOQ item, total value calculation, integration feeds to Break-Down and Invoice modules

**Edge Cases/Exceptions**:
• Zero quantity items allowed for contingency planning but require special approval
• Rate adjustments on approved items trigger change control workflow with impact analysis
• Bulk import failures require individual item validation and error correction procedures

### 4.2 Hierarchical BOQ Structure Management

**When Used**: During project setup and when organizing work packages into logical groupings

**Step-by-Step Flow**:
• User defines parent-child relationships between BOQ items for work breakdown structure
• System validates hierarchical integrity and prevents circular references
• Parent items automatically calculate aggregate quantities and values from children
• System maintains level-based permissions and inheritance rules for approval workflows
• Roll-up calculations update automatically when child items are modified or added

**Business Rules/Validations**:
• Maximum hierarchy depth limited to 5 levels for system performance and user clarity
• Parent items cannot have direct quantities; values derived from child items only
• Child item modifications trigger automatic parent recalculation and approval review
• Level-based access controls ensure appropriate review authorities at each hierarchy level

### 4.3 BOQ Approval Workflow

**When Used**: When new items are created, existing items are modified, or bulk changes are imported

**Step-by-Step Flow**:
• System routes BOQ items to appropriate approvers based on value thresholds and organizational matrix
• Reviewers receive notifications with item details, impact analysis, and recommendation requirements
• Approvers can approve, reject, or request modifications with mandatory comments and justifications
• Approved items become available for Break-Down creation and WIR referencing
• Rejected items return to draft status with reviewer feedback for correction and resubmission
• System maintains complete audit trail of all approval decisions and timing

**Business Rules/Validations**:
• Items above $50,000 require dual approval from technical and commercial reviewers
• Emergency approvals available for critical path items with post-approval validation required
• Bulk approvals limited to similar item types with aggregate value restrictions
• Approval authority cannot be delegated without formal delegation documentation and system recording

### 4.4 BOQ Variation Management

**When Used**: When project scope changes, quantities need adjustment, or rates require updating

**Step-by-Step Flow**:
• User initiates variation request with change justification and impact assessment
• System calculates financial impact and identifies affected Break-Downs and WIRs
• Change request routes through approval workflow with stakeholder impact notifications
• Approved variations update BOQ baseline with version control and historical preservation
• System automatically notifies affected modules and triggers cascade updates where required
• Change documentation generated for contract administration and audit purposes

**Business Rules/Validations**:
• Variations exceeding 10% of original item value require client pre-approval
• Rate changes must include market justification and competitive analysis
• Quantity reductions require verification that work has not already been completed
• All variations maintain traceability to original change requests and approvals
